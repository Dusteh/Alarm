Yep it's a damn simple command line alarm clock, it plays my local NPR station at 5am at this point
I've not yet written any configuration HTML for it, and may at some point.

This application accepts a command line argument of alarm=[TIME] 
where [TIME] is a hour:minute combination on the 24hr clock.


Reminder to mysel, this is for NODE!
